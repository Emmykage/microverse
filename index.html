                  <p>All these factors change through time. Some factors, such as the distribution of heat within the oceans,
                      atmospheric chemistry, and surface vegetation, change at very short timescales. Others, such as the position
                      of continents and the location and height of mountain ranges, change over very long timescales. </p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.

                  <p> The atmosphere is a dynamic fluid that is continually in motion. Both its physical properties and its rate
                      and direction of motion are influenced by a variety of factors, including solar radiation, the geographic
                      position of continents, ocean currents, the location and orientation of mountain ranges, atmospheric
                      chemistry, and vegetation growing on the land surface.</p>

                  <p>The nature of the evidence for climate change is explained, as are the principal mechanisms that have caused
                  climate change throughout the history of Earth. Finally</p>
              detailed description is given of climate change over many different timescales, ranging from a typical human
                  life span to all of geologic time. Therefore, climate, which results from the physical properties and motion of the atmosphere, varies at every
                  conceivable timescale.</p>

              <p>The atmosphere is influenced by and linked to other features of Earth, including oceans, ice masses (glaciers
                  and sea ice), land surfaces, and vegetation.</p>
              <p>Together, they make up an integrated Earth system, in which all components interact with and influence one
                  another in often complex ways.</p>
