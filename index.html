        <p> The atmosphere is a dynamic fluid that is continually in motion. Both its physical properties and its rate
            and direction of motion are influenced by a variety of factors, including solar radiation, the geographic
            position of continents, ocean currents, the location and orientation of mountain ranges, atmospheric
            chemistry, and vegetation growing on the land surface.</p>
        <code>
                let num = 15;
                let text = num.toString();
                document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = text;
            </code>
        <p>All these factors change through time. Some factors, such as the distribution of heat within the oceans,
            atmospheric chemistry, and surface vegetation, change at very short timescales. Others, such as the position
            of continents and the location and height of mountain ranges, change over very long timescales. </p>
        <p>Therefore, climate, which results from the physical properties and motion of the atmosphere, varies at every
            conceivable timescale.</p>
        <code>
                let num = 15;
                let text = num.toString();
                document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = text;
            </code>
        <p>This article addresses the concept of climatic variation and change within the set of integrated natural
            features and processes known as the Earth system.</p>
        <p>The nature of the evidence for climate change is explained, as are the principal mechanisms that have caused
            climate change throughout the history of Earth. Finally</p>
        <p>detailed description is given of climate change over many different timescales, ranging from a typical human
            life span to all of geologic time.</p>
        <code>
                let num = 15;
                let text = num.toString();
                document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = text;

        <p>The atmosphere is influenced by and linked to other features of Earth, including oceans, ice masses (glaciers
            and sea ice), land surfaces, and vegetation.</p>
        <p>Together, they make up an integrated Earth system, in which all components interact with and influence one
            another in often complex ways.</p>
        <code>
                let num = 15;
                let text = num.toString();
                document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = text;
